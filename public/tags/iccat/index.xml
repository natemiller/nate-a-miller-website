      <description>Take-home This is an analysis of the observer reported transshipments from ICCAT. These events were recorded between 2017 and mid-2018. The attempt is made here to determine how well the GFW events (encounters/likely transshipments and loitering events) approximate actual events. This was done by identifying the proximity of these events to actual observer reported transshipments.
Transshipment Features We found that transshipment events generall occur quickly with most requring 1-2 hours median: 132.</description>
